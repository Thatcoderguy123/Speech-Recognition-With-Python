# Speech-Recognition-With-Python
Don't you just hate taking notes on lectures and videos? Well, if you do, you came to the right place. Here, we convert audio from a .wav file or use your microphone's input to convert it to text.

BTW, THIS WON'T WORK ON MACBOOK's WITH M1 CHIPS!!!

To run this, go to terminal and type (one at a time!!!): 'pip3 install kivy', 'pip3 install SpeechRecognition', 'pip3 install filestack-python'
Then do: 'mkdir github'
Then: 'cd github'
Then click on the code tab here and you should see 'HTTPS' and see a url. Copy that url. 
Then, in terminal, type: 'git clone (insert url)'
Then:  'cd Speech-Recognition-With-Python'. 
Then: 'cd code'
Then: 'python main.py'
